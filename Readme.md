2. Based on the emotion it shows playlist to the user.
3. When user clicks on songs it redirects them to Spotify website.

## Challenges we ran into
It was a challenging task to get the website to access 7 song templates from the songs button based on the emotion recognized. Dynamic links were used as a means to access the templates for the songs corresponding to the output of the model.

## What's next for **Melodify**
The next step is to further improve the model's accuracy and enhance the UI/UX of the web app.
